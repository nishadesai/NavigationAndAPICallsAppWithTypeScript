# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```
## Usage

To start the Expo development server and run the app on your device or emulator, use the following commands:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```
Or using npx:

```bash
npx expo start
```

Or if you have expo-cli installed globally:

```bash
expo start
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
